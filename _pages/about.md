Hello. My name is Justin and I am working on my PhD in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at the University of California, San Diego. My research interests include scientific machine learning, tensor algebra, and high-performance computing, with broad applications in science and engineering. I am advised by [Dr. Boris Krämer](https://kramer.ucsd.edu/index.html).

I previously interned as a SULI software engineer at [Oak Ridge National Laboratory](https://www.ornl.gov/group/application-engineering) and as an X‑ray CT systems engineer at [VJ Technologies](https://vjt.com/). Before going to UC San Diego, I earned my B.S. in Physics from the University of California, Riverside and M.S. in Computational Applied Mathematics from Stony Brook University.
